				<p>Some remote Indigenous communities may not have access to reliable broadband internet service, so it is important to always follow up with a telephone call after communicating with them by email.</p>

				<p><strong>You should contact each community individually</strong>. Bear in mind that communities often have capacity issues and setting up a meeting can take some time.</p>

				<p>There are a few things to consider once initial contact has been established. We will explore these aspects in later sections of the present document.</p>

			<div class="col-md-8 alignLeft ae-4 slideInBottom">
				<p>Ask if a community Elder will be or should be opening and/or closing the meeting. </p>

				
					<p>Learn about the Elder and their role in the community, as the definition of an Elder varies between First Nations, Inuit and Métis. You will feel more at ease if you familiarize yourself with the different practices of the community you are visiting. </p>
				
					<p>Visit the <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-2">Kumik Lodge</a> or the Iskotew Lodge to get additional information and guidance on Elders and their role. </p>
				
					<p>Ask what opening and closing ceremonies will be performed; there may be a prayer, traditional song and drum, a smudging, lighting of the qulliq or pipe ceremony, among other practices or traditions. Following the traditional spiritual protocols of the community is important in many Indigenous communities. Confirm with the community representatives. </p>

				<p>Note: Should you be asked to take part in a <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-3">smudging</a> ceremony, a <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-4">pipe ceremony</a>, a <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-5">sweat lodge</a> or a <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-6">traditional dance</a>, be mindful that this invitation was not extended to you lightly. Such an invitation is an honour, and unless there is a medical or other substantive reason why you should not join in, it is strongly encouraged that you accept with humility and respect.</p>

				<p>It is important to ask about the protocols for participating in ceremonies. For example, there are certain ceremonies that are specific to women and to men. If you are not sure, do not be afraid to ask the Elder for guidance on the purpose of the ceremony and what is expected of you.</p>

				<p>Elders are designated by the community. They are people who have wisdom but also cultural experience. They have seen many things and know how to transmit this knowledge. </p>
				<p>It apparently has nothing to do with age. It has something to do with wisdom.</p>
				<p>Before becoming who I am today, there was a learning process. I studied with Elders. And every Elder, what we mean by Elder, is a person who has gone through a lot of initiation to really understand all about medecine.</p>
				<p>There’s a difference between an Elder and a knowledge keeper. The term knowledge keeper is a contemporary title. I will never say I’m an Elder because the Elders, the Inuit Elders, they are a very select group. They are a group that have all their understanding and their knowledge from their life experiences of living on the land and living in their values.  </p>
				<p>If I’m asked for my opinion about some of the items that are being discussed, I will just tell them what I know, and I think I’ve gathered that through all the various experiences that I’ve had over the years.</p>
				<p>As far as I’m concerned, there should always be an Elder present. Because it’s often a political meeting; we forget about culture. The Elder is there to talk about the culture. As we’ve seen in certain communities these days, there’s a conflict there. But personally, I think it would be good, because it’s the Elder who can bring in the history of the culture before we get into the politics of the culture.</p>

					<p>It’s not that people don’t understand, you know. It’s that they just don’t know what to do, right. And it creates a nervousness, or it might create a block between, let’s say, the employee and the Elder.</p>
					<p>The government will spend lots of time preparing for a business negotiation, but with First Nations, it’s like they show up without any idea of what happened to those communities in the past. And often, a community will feel hurt because it feels like they don’t even know who we are. It’s about taking the time to get to know the people you’ll be engaging and dealing with.</p>
					<p>One size fits all will not work. So you have to learn the dynamics of the community you’re going to visit.</p>
					<p>Everyone says we’re the “First Nations,” but from east to west, there are almost 600 First Nations communities. I’m from the Gaspésie. Our protocols are different than those in Nova Scotia, even if we’re from the same nation. That means you have to ask. You have to take the time to do research and ask the right questions.</p>
					<p>You can look up the community on the internet and find out what the population is and who the people are, like the Council and the various people and who you’re going to be meeting with. And if you need help, you can phone the hamlet office or the village office, or whatever, to speak to someone who can recommend to you a person who is willing to take care of you once you get there in terms of—or even before you get there—let you know the lay of the land, kind of thing. And also what you should and shouldn’t do.</p>
					<p>Just because we’re Inuit, that does not mean we’re all the same. Different regions have different mannerisms. So you have to adapt to their ways, how they do things and who is who. So it’s important to get yourself a liaison. A liaison is a person who speaks the language, who knows the community as a whole and who knows the people, and who knows the Elders. The liaison is very important. They will direct you to the right person at the right time.</p>
					<p>I believe that moving forward means moving forward in knowledge.</p>
					<p>We’re in a period of great openness on the part of the government, and we appreciate that. But everything has to be treated with a great deal of respect so it’s not just a leaf in the wind.</p>
