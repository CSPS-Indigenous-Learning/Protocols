			<div class="col-md-6 alignLeft ae-4 slideInLeft">
				<p>In the case of informal or traditional gatherings, the meeting may be set up in a circle to encourage open dialogue. </p>

				<p>The circle symbolizes equality amongst participants. Everyone has the right to speak and everyone’s opinion has value. A few details to observe during the talking circle:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Make sure you turn off your mobile device</li>
					<li>If an Elder is present, they usually speak first</li>
					<li>Practice active listening while someone is speaking</li>
					<li>It is okay not to say anything; the unsaid also communicates important information</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In Inuit cultures, a conversation may be initiated by participating in an activity or sharing a cup of tea. The approach is usually less formal.</p>

			<div class="col-md-4 alignLeft ae-4 slideInLeft">
				<p>The Elder may also close the meeting. </p>

				<p>Note: If the community invites you to stay for a meal, it is recommended that you stay. In most Indigenous cultures, sharing food (“the feast”) is an important part of any gathering. Remember that if an Elder is present, he or she eats first.</p>

			<h2 class="col-md-12 ae-1 slideInTop">Etiquette</h2>
			<div class="col-md-6 alignLeft ae-4 slideInLeft">
				<p>Do not overdress. Business casual is usually appropriate. Wearing clothing that is too formal may set the wrong tone for the encounter. </p>

				<p>Understand that body language is an important part of communication and that gestures can have different meanings. Examples of body language can be eye contact, handshakes, personal space, tone of voice, personal touch and posture. Be open to different communication styles. </p>

				<p>There is a misconception in mainstream Canadian urban or business culture that if someone is not maintaining eye contact, they are insincere or disinterested. However, some cultures do not favour direct eye contact; in some cases, direct eye contact can be seen as intimidating or disrespectful. </p>

				<p>Some Indigenous people will not maintain eye contact or they may look over your shoulder or to the side of you. For those who attended residential schools, direct eye contact with church officials would often result in physical punishment.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6 alignLeft ae-4 slideInRight">
				<p>A simple, natural handshake is more than welcome. However, be aware of the firmness of your grip. Too firm a grip, or the use of your other hand to hold on to your counterpart’s elbow or shoulder could be perceived as a desire to dominate this new relationship.</p>

				<p>Respect pauses and silence in discussions. Some participants may be taking some time to think and formulate their opinion. This may feel uncomfortable at first, but silence doesn’t mean the conversation is not going well. </p>

				<p>Nodding is a respectful way to acknowledge the speaker and communicate while not being disruptive.
				</p>

				<p>Again, it is recommended that you ask the community representatives about appropriate protocol in this area. </p>
